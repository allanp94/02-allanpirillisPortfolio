## About
Personal Portfolio for an assignment and future use also. 

It has been fun and interesting creating this long overdue portoflio for myself where i can showcase my personal touch on the website itself but also share some information about myself, projects i have worked on, but most importantly how to contact me!! 

---

## Direction
The personal portfolio is far from finished; as of 03.14.21 it has the core functionality that meets the acceptance criteria for the assignemnt. As more projects are started/completed they will be posted and updated on the portfolio. The portfolio is also an on going "try it here first" mentality website and will reflect my progress throughout my journey of becoming a Full Stack Web Developer and beyond.
